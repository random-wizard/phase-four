Phase Four
==========

Dice
----

PHASE FOUR mainly uses a twenty sided dice for character creation and
task resolution. Since the lowest number that can be rolled is the
number 1 and the highest number is 20, a twenty sided dice is
abbreviated as 1d20 in this text. Occasionally, PHASE FOUR uses other
various sided dice and they are denoted by similar notation such as 1d6,
1d8, and so on.

Fast Play
---------

This volume of PHASE FOUR is written to enable fast play. The nature of
the rules are deliberately terse so as to allow customization and house
rules. The bulk of the rules detail how to create a character. Many of
the powers, skills, and gameplay options will mention the players should
discuss additional options and ideas with the Gamemaster.

Character Origin
----------------

The first step in character creation is to determine the character's
origin. Roll 1d20 on the "Origin" table.

ORIGIN

| Roll  | Origin        |
|-------|---------------|
| 01-02 | Robot         |
| 03-04 | Alien         |
| 05-09 | Skilled Human |
| 10-13 | Changed Human |
| 14-17 | Mutated Human |
| 18-19 | Technology    |
| 20-20 | Magic         |

Robot: An automaton, an intelligent machine, or a magical construct such
as a golem.

Alien: A visitor from another world or dimension, such as a Martian,
advanced lizardmen from another galaxy or even beings made of pure
energy.

Skilled Human: A highly skilled human whose powers are derived from
superior training or specialized devices.

Changed Human: A normal human who became superhuman through some outside
agency, often an accident or experiment.

Mutated Human: A human with changes to DNA that enables superpowers,
perhaps from random chance at birth or from external factors later in
life.

Technology: The character's powers are the result of computer
enhancements, cybernetic implants, advanced devices or other gadgets.

Magic: The character's powers are derived from mystical forces such as a
witch's curse, studying ancient scrolls, or wearing a magic amulet.

Attributes
----------

Characters are defined by a set of attributes. Each attribute is given a
score which is an indicator of how adept a character is in that
particular area. Each character will have a set of seven attributes;
Combat, Strength, Toughness, Reflexes, Insight, Knowledge, Ego
(sometimes the list of attributes are abbreviated as Combat
S.T.R.I.K.E.)

Combat: The measure of a character's fighting capability. Used when
doing battle with opponents with melee weapons, hand to hand
combat, or physical powers.

Strength: The measure of a character's physical power. Used when lifting
heavy objects, determining damage with punching or throwing, or
otherwise engaged in activities relying on raw physical power.

Toughness: The measure of a character's stamina and robustness. Used
when attempting to resist sickness, overcome toxins, ignore fatigue,
hold breath or otherwise engaged in physically strenuous tasks.

Reflexes: The measure of a character's speed, balance and grace. Used
when aiming, throwing, balancing, or otherwise employing physical
nimbleness.

Insight: The measure of the character's insight. Used when attempting to
sense danger, spot something, recognize a hunch, or otherwise work on
instinct rather than analyzing a situation.

Knowledge: The measure of the character's knowledge and reasoning. Used
when attempting to solve a problem, invent a gadget, decipher a code, or
rely on logic.

Ego: The measure of the character's mental strength. Used when
attempting to resist hypnosis, sleep, using psychic abilities, or
otherwise using powers of the mind.

Rank Values
-----------

Rank Values are the numerical representation of attributes, skills and
powers. Rank Values range from 0 to 1000. Most characters will have Rank
Values in the 10-50 range.

RANK VALUE

| Value | Description           |
|-------|-----------------------|
| 1     | Minimum human ability |
| 2     | Below average human   |
| 5     | Average human         |
| 10    | Above average human   |
| 20    | Exceptional human     |
| 30    | Maximum human limit   |
| 40    | Low superhuman        |
| 50    | Superhuman            |
| 75    | High superhuman       |
| 100   | Low cosmic            |
| 200   | Cosmic                |
| 300   | High cosmic           |
| 400   | Demigod               |
| 500   | Beyond comprehension  |

Attribute Rank Values
---------------------

Roll 1d20 once on the Attribute Rank table for each attribute to
determine the Rank Value of that attribute.

ATTRIBUTE RANK

| Roll  | Rank |
|-------|------|
| 01-01 | 2    |
| 02-02 | 5    |
| 03-04 | 10   |
| 05-08 | 20   |
| 09-12 | 30   |
| 13-18 | 40   |
| 19-19 | 50   |
| 20-20 | 75   |

Secondary Attributes
--------------------

There are a set of attributes which are derived from the primary
attributes instead of rolled for during character creation. These
attributes are known as secondary attributes. Health Pool: Represents
the amount of damage a character can take before they are rendered
unconscious or inert. Health is determined by adding up the Rank Value
of Combat, Strength, Toughness, and Reflexes.

Energy Pool: Represents the amount of cosmic energy and innate luck the
character possesses. Energy is determined by adding up the Rank Value of
Insight, Knowledge, and Ego. Energy has the special property of being
spent to shift results of the Master Table (see Altering the Dice).

Rank Step
---------

When an attribute or power gets an increase or decrease, the term Rank
Step (abbreviated as RS) is often used. For example, if a character has
a Strength attribute of 50 and rolls a power that gives the character a
+1 RS to to their Strength, then the character's Strength attribute
would be bumped up to the next rank of 75. Optionally, if the Gamemaster
wishes to avoid consulting the chart, Rank Step can simply be converted
to an adjustment to the player roll of the 1d20. Take the -1 RS, -2 RS,
+1 RS, +2 RS and apply it directly to the number the player rolls on the
1d20. To save time from consulting with the chart, have the player write
down the 3 target numbers corresponding to their Rank Value. For
example, if a character has a Strength of 30, they would write down
Strength 30 - 9/14/18 This can save time by eliminating the chart as the
game is played. The 9 denotes a result of green, the 14 a result of
yellow, and the 18 a result of red.

Master Table
------------

The Master Table is the main mechanism for determining success or
failure for a task. The table is color coded to show differing degrees
of success and failure. The higher a character's Rank Value, the more
likely that character will succeed. It is the Gamemaster's role to
adjudicate how difficult or easy something is to accomplish and adjust
the difficulty by adding or subtracting Rank Step before the player
rolls. For example, if a character has a Strength attribute of 50 and
attempts to flip over a car right after somersaulting across an enemy,
the Gamemaster may adjudicate that the character is at -2 RS. This makes
the task more difficult by adjusting down to a the 30 Rank Value. An
optional rule is to implement fumbles. A Blue result means the character
failed in a detrimental way, such as dropping their weapon or falling
down while attempting an action.

MASTER TABLE

| Rank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

MASTER TABLE RESULTS

|     | Color  | Result          |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
|     | White  | Failed Attempt  |
| G   | Green  | Minor Success   |
| Y   | Yellow | Average Success |
| R   | Red    | Major Success   |

Interpreting Results
--------------------

The color coded results give only a general
interpretation of the success of an action. The Gamemaster will have to
interpret what failure or success entails based upon the situation and
the characters involved. For combat actions, special result tables are
given that give more guidance for interpreting results (See Combat,
Bashing, Slashing, Ranged and Rushing).

Skills
------

After determining a character's origins and attributes, the next step in
the character creation process is to determine skills. If the situation
a character faces can be linked to the use of a related to the skill in
some way, the character will receive a bonus to their roll. For example,
if a character is attempting to bluff a guard, the task resolution would
be to roll against the character's Ego. But if the character also
possessed the acting skill they would get a bonus for their roll to
increase their chances of successfully duping the guard.

Using Skills
------------

A skill grants a +1 RS when making any rolls on the Master Table during
an action appropriate to the skill in question.

Determine Skill Number
----------------------

To determine the number of skills a character possesses roll 1d20 on the
"Skill Number" table.

SKILL NUMBER

| Roll  | Number of Skills |
|-------|------------------|
| 01-04 | 1                |
| 05-12 | 2                |
| 13-18 | 3                |
| 19-20 | 4                |

Determine Skills
----------------

To determine which skills a character possesses roll 1d20 on the "Skill
List" table. If the same skill is rolled more than once, the character
possesses advanced knowledge of the skill.

Additional Skills
-----------------

The table provided is by no means a comprehensive list of all possible
skills in the universe. Players that wish to possess a skill not listed
here are encouraged to discuss the idea with the Gamemaster.

Powers
------

Powers are what make a character something beyond the average day person
on the street. Powers are broken down into four categories; Attack,
Defense, Movement, and Utility. Many powers will require the player and
the gamemaster to flesh out more detail before or during play.

Determine Power Number
----------------------

To determine which types of power a character possesses, roll 1d20 on
the "Power Type" table. After all of the power types have been
determined, if the player does not have at least one attack power type,
they can change one of their types to an attack power type if they so
choose.

POWER NUMBER

| Roll  | Number of Powers |
|-------|------------------|
| 01-05 | 2                |
| 06-16 | 3                |
| 17-18 | 4                |
| 19-20 | 5                |

Determine Power Type
--------------------

To determine which types of power a character possesses, roll 1d20 on
the "Power Type" table. After all of the power types have been
determined, if the player does not have at least one attack power type,
they can change one of their types to an attack power type if they so
choose.

POWER TYPE

| 19-20 | Attack        |

Determine Power Find the power type and roll 1d20 on the corresponding
"Power Utility", "Power Movement", "Power Defense", or "Power Attack"
table. If the player rolls the same power twice, they can elect to
either increase the power's Rank Value by +2 RS or roll again for a
different power.

Power Rank Values
-----------------

Roll 1d20 once on the "Power Rank" table for each Power to determine its
Rank Value.

POWER RANK

| Roll  | Rank |
|-------|------|
| 01-01 | 2    |
| 02-02 | 5    |
| 03-04 | 10   |

| 09-12 | 30   |
| 13-18 | 40   |
| 19-19 | 50   |
| 20-20 | 75   |

Power Description
-----------------

A short descriptions of the various powers is provided. Each description
includes general ways in which the power can be used during a game
session. Not every situation can be covered in the rules, so certain
results and effects will have to be adjudicated by the Gamemaster as
events unfold.

Absorption
----------

The character is immune to damage inflicted by a specific elemental or
energy type up to the Rank Value of this power. Any damage inflicted
over the Rank Value of this power is suffered normally. The character
may use the absorbed energy in one of two ways: 1 . Healing. The
character instantly recovers a number of Health points equal to the
damage absorbed, up to his maximum value. 2. Attack. The character, on
his next turn, may unleash the absorbed energy as an attack. Treat as an
appropriate elemental or energy control attack with a Rank Value equal
to the number of Health points absorbed.

Amphibian
---------

The character has the ability to move and breath under water. When
swimming, the character moves a number of Sectors determined by the Rank
Value of this power.

AMPHIBIAN

| Value | Sectors/Move |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 1            |
| 10    | 2            |
| 30    | 3            |
| 50    | 4            |
| 100   | 5            |

Animal Command
--------------

The character can communicate with and control animals. To successfully
communicate with an animal the character must roll 1d20 on the Master
Table using the Rank Value of this power or the character's Ego +1 RS,
whichever is greater. A result of green or greater indicates successful
communication. To control an animal, the character must achieve a result
of red. The character can control one type of animal (such as birds,
reptiles, mammals, sea creatures, etc.), which must be determined at the
time of the character's creation.

Attribute Boost
---------------

This power is a temporary boost to any one primary attribute of the
character's choice (chosen at the time this power is acquired). Once
each hour of game time the character can automatically boost the chosen
attribute Rank Value by an amount equal to the Rank Value of this
power. The duration of affected primary attribute is determined by the
Rank Value of the power using the "Attribute Boost" table. At the end of
this time the affected primary attribute's Rank Value is reduced to
one-half its normal Rank Value for 1d6 turns.

ATTRIBUTE BOOST

| Value | Turn |
|-------|------|
| 1     | 1    |
| 2     | 2    |
| 5     | 3    |
| 10    | 4    |
| 20    | 5    |
| 30    | 6    |
| 40    | 7    |
| 50    | 8    |
| 75    | 9    |
| 100   | 10   |
| 200   | 12   |
| 300   | 13   |
| 400   | 14   |
| 500   | 15   |

Body Armour
-----------

The character has armour of some kind, perhaps thick hide or a
protective bodysuit, which reduces damage by an amount equal to the Rank
Value of this power.

Burrowing
---------

The character possesses the ability to tunnel beneath the earth, moving
at a rate equal to his normal running speed (see Sectors and Movement)
through any subterranean terrain with a material rank equal to or less
than the Rank Value of this power. The character cannot burrow through
other characters.

Chameleon
---------

The character's body, as well as worn or carried items, can be changed
at will allowing the character to blend into the surroundings. This is
similar to the Invisibility power, except it is easier to detect the
character; anyone searching for the character rolls 1d20 and adds the
Rank Value of their Insight attribute to the roll and compares it
against the character's 1d20 roll plus the Rank Value of this power. If
the character rolls higher than the searcher the character remains
hidden.

Claws
-----

The character has some form of claws, either a natural part of the
character's body or a worn item. The character uses the Rank Value of
either the character's combat attribute or this power to make slashing
attacks. Claws are treated as a one-handed weapon for purposes of
damage. Optional: Instead of claws the character possesses another type
of weapon of the player's choosing which may be used for bashing or
slashing attacks (choose one).

Danger Sense
------------

The character has a special sense that alerts the character to danger
seconds before it strikes. In all instances in which the Insight
attribute is used the character uses the Rank Value of this power or the
character's Insight attribute +1 RS, whichever is greater.

Elemental/Energy Control
------------------------

The character has the ability to control a single element or type of
energy chosen from the "Energy Types" or "Elemental Types" lists. The
character can only manipulate an existing source of the element or
energy; the character does not possess the ability to spontaneously
create the element or energy.

Electrical: The character can manipulate electricity to attack, create
force fields, lift objects, etc.

Light: The character can manipulate light to attack, blind opponents,
create force fields, etc.

Magnetic: The character can manipulate ferrous metals to attack, create
walls of metal that act as armour, lift metallic objects, etc.

Sound: The character can manipulate sound to attack, lift objects,
create force fields, etc.

Weather Control: A subset of elemental/energy control, a character may
choose to manipulate the weather. This power can be especially powerful
since it allows a character to manipulate air, lightning, rain, and any
other aspect associated with storms/weather so the Gamemaster may choose
to have Weather Control count as two of a character's powers.

Elemental Types
---------------

Air: The character can manipulate winds to attack, create force fields,
lift objects, etc.

Earth: The character can manipulate the ground to attack, create walls
of earth that act as armour, lift objects, etc.

Fire: The character can manipulate fire to attack, increase or decrease
the temperate of a flame, create a wall of fire like a force field, etc.

Water: The character can manipulate water to attack, create walls of
water that act as armour, lift objects, etc.

Elemental/Energy Effects
------------------------

Attacking: A character using Elemental/Energy Control to attack may use
either the power's Rank Value or the character's combat attribute Rank
Value +1 RS, whichever is greater, for melee attacks. For ranged attacks
use the power's Rank Value or the character's Reflexes Rank Value +1 RS.
Damage inflicted in either case is equal to the power's Rank Value.
Force Field: See the Force Field power. Body Armour: See the Body Armour
power. Lifting Objects: See the Telekinesis power.

Elemental/Energy Generation
---------------------------

The character has the ability to spontaneously generate a single element
or type of energy chosen from the the Elemental/Energy Control power
list. The character can also control the chosen element or energy as per
the Elemental/Energy Control power but that control is at an effective
Rank Value equal to one-half the Rank Value of this power.

Detailing Powers
----------------

Elemental/Energy Control/Generation can lead to overpowered characters.
Like proverbial clay, the power to wield an Element or Energy source can
be used to make almost anything to overcome any situation if left
unchecked. Players are encouraged to describe the power with the
Gamemaster and work out a more nuanced description of the power. Perhaps
the character can only generate a flame bolt from their hands, for
example. Or the effort of controlling a magnetic field creates a serious
strain on the characters resources, leaving them in a weakend state for
1d6 turns. Remember, the best heroes always have limitations and
weaknesses.

Copying Powers
--------------

A great way to add detail to Elemental and Energy powers is to have the
player roll two or three times on the Power Type table and then reskin
all the results to be created through the Element or Energy. For
example, if the player rolls for a fire based Elemental Generation, they
then proceed to roll again and get Extra Body Parts. Simply reskin the
Extra Body Parts as a ghostly demonic flaming whip like appendage that
the character can summon for a limited duration.

Combining Powers
----------------

A player that rolls both Elemental/Energy Control and Elemental/Energy
Generation can choose separate types; fire vs. water for example. Or the
player may elect to have the Control and Generation coincide with the
same type. Such characters possessing matching Elemental/Energy Control
and Elemental/Energy Generation gain a permanent +1 RS to both powers.

Fast Attack Extra Body Parts Through technology, a mutation, magic or
some means, the character has enhanced ability to react and move while
making an attack. A character with the Fast Attack power can attack a
number of times each turn depending on the Rank Value of the power using
the "Fast Attack" table.

FAST ATTACK

| Value | Attacks/Turn |

Extra Body Parts
----------------

The character additional body parts beyond two arms and two legs, either
a completely new part, such as a tail, or extras of an existing part.
The player chooses one option from the "Extra Body Part Types" list.

Extra Body Part Types
---------------------

Claws: The character gains the Claws power. If the character already
possesses the Claws power the power's Rank Value is increased by +2 RS.
Extra Arms: The character gains one bonus attack each turn. Extra Legs:
The character moves faster; increase movement by 1 sector each turn.
Shell: The character gains the Body Armour power. If the character
already possesses the Body Armour power then the power's Rank Value is
increased by +2 RS. Tail: The character gains one bonus attack each turn
and may use the tail as if it were an extra arm. Wings: The character
gains the Flight power with the speed determined by the Rank Value of
this power. If the character already possesses the Flight power then the
power's Rank Value is increased by +2 RS.

Flight
------

The character can fly either through the use of an item or by innate
means. A character with the Flight power can fly a number of sectors per
turn depending on the Rank Value of the power using the "Flight" table.

FLIGHT

| Value | Sectors/Turn |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 1            |
| 2     | 2            |
| 5     | 3            |
| 10    | 4            |
| 20    | 5            |

| 300   | 30           |
| 400   | 60           |
| 500   | 120          |

Force Field
-----------

The character has the ability to generate a force field, either through
mental powers or a device. Device: The force field acts as the Body
Armour power with a Rank Value equal to the power's Rank Value. If an
attack deals damage in excess of this force field's Rank Value the
device is disabled for 1d6 turns. Mental: The force field acts as the
Body Armour power with a Rank Value equal to the power's Rank Value or
the character's Ego +1 RS, whichever is greater. If an attack deals
damage in excess of the Rank Value, the character must roll 1d20 on the
Master Table using the Rank Value of the character's Toughness. A result
of white leaves the character dazed for 1d6 turns. On any other result
the character is dazed for one turn.

Grow/Shrink Invisibility
------------------------

The character can grow larger or smaller. The player must select one or
the other. If Grow/Shrink is rolled twice, the character has both
powers. A character with the Grow/Shrink power can grow or shrink
depending on the Rank Value of the power using the "Grow/Shrink" table.

GROW/SHRINK

| Value | Maximum  | Minimum   |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1     | 7 feet   | 4 feet    |
| 2     | 8 feet   | 3 feet    |
| 5     | 9 feet   | 2 feet    |
| 10    | 10 feet  | 1 foot    |
| 20    | 20 feet  | 6 inches  |
| 30    | 30 feet  | 3 inches  |
| 40    | 40 feet  | 2 inches  |
| 50    | 50 feet  | 1 inch    |
| 75    | 75 feet  | 1/2 inch  |
| 100   | 100 feet | 1/4 inch  |
| 200   | 200 feet | 1/8 inch  |
| 300   | 300 feet | 1/16 inch |
| 400   | 400 feet | 1/32 inch |
| 500   | 500 feet | 1/64 inch |

When using the Grow power, the Rank Value of the character's Strength is
changed to the Rank Value of this power or the character's Strength Rank
Value +1 RS, whichever is greater. Opponents attacking the bigger
character gain a +1 RS bonus on their attacks. When using the Shrink
power the Rank Value of the character's Strength is unaffected. Anyone
attacking the character when using this power suffers a -1 RS penalty
and the character gains a +2 RS bonus to attacks.

Invisibility
------------

The character can become invisible and remain so for as long as desired.
Sound, scent, heavy rain, and other methods can still give an invisible
character away. The character may also attempt to turn objects or other
characters invisible by touching them. Roll 1d20 on the Master Table
using the Rank Value of this power, on a result of green or greater the
item or character touched is invisible and remains so as long as the
character touches it.

Metamorphosis
-------------

The character's body can change into an unusual material, selected from
the "Metamorphosis Types". When metamorphosed the character possesses
the attributes of the material and gains the Body Armour power equal to
the Rank Value of this power.

Metamorphosis Types
-------------------

Energy: The character transforms into a being of pure energy (choose
electricity, light, radiation, etc.). When in energy form the character
may do such things as: Jump into power lines and travel through them.
(Electricity) Move at the speed of light. (Light) Cause radiation burns
and sickness. (Radiation) Fire: The character transforms into a being of
pure fire. When in fire form the character is capable of setting things
on fire. Metal: The character transforms into a being of pure metal
(player's choice as to the kind of metal). The Rank Value of the
character's Strength is changed to the Rank Value of this power or the
Strength Rank Value +1 RS, whichever is greater. Water: The character
transforms into a being of pure water. When in water form the character
may choose to flow like water, running through cracks and other small
spaces. Damage: Depending on the form and Gamemaster approval the
character may make use of the Rank Value of this power to determine
damage when attacking (punching with fists of steel, igniting things if
made of fire, etc.).

Mimic
-----

The character can mimic any power they come into contact with. The power
rank value of the character's newly acquired power will be at the
inherent power rank of the mimic power, which may be higher or lower
than the source. The character will only posses the power for 1d20
turns. The character can not mimic more than one power at a time.

Mind Control
------------

The character can take over the minds of others. A target of Mind
Control must be within visual range of the character and must possess a
Ego Rank Value less than the Rank Value of this power or the character's
Ego, whichever is greater.

To take control of another, the character must roll 1d20 on the Master
Table using the Rank Value of this power or the character's Ego +1 RS,
whichever is greater. A result of white means the mind control attempt
fails. A result of green or greater the target is controlled until the
character releases the targeted character or the target is ordered to do
something out of the ordinary (such as injure a companion) at which
point the target rolls 1d20 on the Master Table using the Rank Value of
the target character's Ego. A result of green or greater is needed to
break free of the mind control.

Mind Shield
-----------

The character has exceptionally powerful will and can resist any sort of
mind control or mental attack. The character can resist any sort of
mental attack by rolling 1d20 and consulting the Master Table. A result
of green or greater means the attack is nullified or reduced.

Nine Lives
----------

The character is exceptionally lucky. Once per game session the player
may re-roll any roll they wish. A character with the Nine Lives power
has an extra pool of Energy every game session determined by the Rank
Value of the power using the "Nine Lives" table.

NINE LIVES

| Value | Extra Energy |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 25           |
| 2     | 25           |
| 5     | 25           |
| 10    | 25           |
| 20    | 50           |
| 30    | 50           |
| 40    | 50           |
| 50    | 50           |
| 75    | 75           |
| 100   | 100          |
| 200   | 200          |
| 300   | 300          |
| 400   | 400          |
| 500   | 500          |

Nullification
-------------

The character possesses the ability to nullify the powers of others
within a number of sectors equal to one-tenth the Rank Value of this
power. To use this power the character must roll 1d20 on the Master
Table using the Rank Value of this power. A result of white means the
nullification attempt fails and the character suffers damage equal to
one-half the Rank Value of the power the character attempted to nullify.
A result of green means the targeted power works at half its
effectiveness. On any other result the power is negated for this turn.

Paralyzing
----------

The character's touch can render opponents unable to move. To paralyze
an opponent the character must first hit with a melee attack which deals
no damage. The target must then roll 1d20 on the Master Table using the
target's Toughness Rank Value to resist. A result of white means the
target is paralyzed, knocked down and unconscious. The duration of
paralysis is determined by the Rank Value of the power using the
"Paralyzing" table.

PARALYZING

| Value | Duration/Turns |
|-------|----------------|
| 1     | 1              |
| 10    | 1d6            |
| 30    | 2d6            |
| 50    | 3d6            |
| 100   | 4d6            |

Phasing
-------

The character's body can change into an insubstantial form allowing the
character to "phase" through objects. The power grants the character the
Body Armour power at the Rank Value of this power.

Plant Control
-------------

The character can control plants, forcing them to twist and turn and
using them to wrestle, attack opponents, or block attacks. The character
performs all of these actions, through a chosen plant, using the Rank
Value of this power or the character's Combat +1 RS, whichever is
greater. The character can control a number of plants each turn equal to
the number of times he can attack in a turn (controlling counts as an
attack). The character can only control plants within a number of
sectors determined by the Rank Value of the power using the "Plant
Control" table.

PLANT CONTROL

| Value | Sectors/Range |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | 1             |
| 2     | 2             |
| 5     | 3             |
| 10    | 4             |
| 20    | 5             |
| 30    | 6             |
| 40    | 7             |
| 50    | 8             |
| 75    | 9             |
| 100   | 10            |
| 200   | 11            |
| 300   | 12            |
| 400   | 13            |
| 500   | 14            |

Reflection
----------

The character possesses the ability to reflect the effects of another
character's power back at the originating character. To use this power
the character must roll 1d20 on the Master Table using the Rank Value of
this power. A result of white means the reflection attempt fails and the
character suffers the normal effects of the power. A result of green
both means the character and the originator of the affected power suffer
the normal effects of the reflected power. On any other result the power
is reflected back and the originator suffers the power's full effect.

Regeneration
------------

The character heals quickly. Once per turn, instead of taking another
action, the character may recover a number of Damage points equal to the
Rank Value of this power.

Resistance
----------

The character possesses a strong resistance to toxins, diseases, and the
like. Any time the character must roll to resist the effects of poison,
disease, or similar environmental hazards the character may use the Rank
Value of this power or the Rank Value of Toughness attribute +1 RS,
whichever is greater.

Shapeshift
----------

The character can turn into any shape desired (animals, other
characters, objects) though the character retains the character's
original size (unless the character also has the Growth or Shrinking
powers). The change is automatically successful unless the character
attempts to impersonate a specific thing (such as another character) at
which point roll 1d20 on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this
power. A result of white means the character fails to adequately copy
the character or object and can be easily identified.

Superleap
---------

The character can perform a leap across a number of sectors determined
by the Rank Value of the power using the "Superleap" table. If the
character performs a superleap and wants to make an physical attack they
can use the Rank Value of this power or the character's Combat +1 RS,
whichever is greater.

SUPERLEAP

| Value | Sectors/Range |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | 1             |
| 2     | 2             |
| 5     | 3             |
| 10    | 4             |
| 20    | 5             |
| 30    | 6             |
| 40    | 7             |
| 50    | 8             |
| 75    | 9             |
| 100   | 10            |
| 200   | 11            |
| 300   | 12            |
| 400   | 13            |
| 500   | 14            |

Supersense
----------

The character possesses a single extraordinary sense such as
superhearing or supersight. Rolls made to use the heightened sense use
this power's Rank Value or the character's Insight +1 RS, whichever is
greater. A player may, with Gamemaster approval, have an entirely new
sense. For example, a character may be blind but possesses echolocation
("seeing" like a bat) or infravision in addition to normal sight
allowing the character to see in darkness without penalty.

Superspeed
----------

The character can run at superhuman speeds. The character can move up to
a number of sectors per turn based on the Rank Value of this power or
the character's Reflexes +1 RS, whichever is greater.

SUPERSPEED

| Value | Sectors/Turn |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 1            |
| 2     | 2            |
| 5     | 3            |
| 10    | 4            |
| 20    | 5            |
| 30    | 6            |
| 40    | 7            |
| 50    | 8            |
| 75    | 9            |
| 100   | 10           |
| 200   | 11           |
| 300   | 12           |
| 400   | 13           |
| 500   | 14           |

When attempting an unusual maneuver, such as running across water or up
walls, the player must roll 1d20 on the Master Table using the Rank
Value of this power or the character's Reflexes +1 RS, whichever is
greater. A result of white indicates failure. During character creation,
if the character rolls the Superspeed power, the player may choose to
change one of their other powers to Fast Attack if they have another
power and they have not already acquired Fast Attack as a power. This
option is completely at the player's discretion.

Telekinesis
-----------

The character possesses the mental ability to move objects without
touching them. The upper limit of weight the character may lift with
this power is the greater of the power's Rank Value or the character's
Ego Rank Value +1 RS.

TELEKINESIS

| Value | Sectors/Turn |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 10 lbs.      |
| 2     | 20 lbs.      |
| 5     | 50 lbs.      |
| 10    | 100 lbs.     |
| 20    | 200 lbs.     |
| 30    | 300 lbs.     |
| 40    | 400 lbs.     |
| 50    | 500 lbs.     |
| 75    | 750 lbs.     |
| 100   | 10 tons      |
| 200   | 20 tons      |
| 300   | 30 tons      |
| 400   | 40 tons      |
| 500   | 50 tons      |

Ranged Attacks: The character may also use this power to perform ranged
attacks by throwing an object or simply using telekinetic "force" by
using the character's Ego in place of Reflexes. A successful attack
deals damage equal to the Rank Value of this power.

Telepathy
---------

The character can read the minds of others and transmit mental messages.
For all actions involving this power the character uses the greater of
the power's Rank Value or the character's Ego +1 RS Rank Value.

A character with this power may attempt to read the mind of any
character with a Ego Rank Value lower than the character's Rank Value. A
character with this power is automatically aware when someone attempts
to read the character's mind. The character may attempt to block the
other telepath. Each turn, the duelling mentalists must each make a
result check against the master table. If the defender matches the
result color or better than the attacker's roll, then the defender
successfully wards off any mind reading attempts for that turn.

Teleportation
-------------

The character may teleport a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value
of this power in a single turn. Teleporting requires the player to roll
1d20 on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power. A result of
white means the character arrives dazed at the destination sector and
must spend the next turn recovering (the character may take no actions
that turn). If the character is unfamiliar with the destination sector
and teleports into a solid object the player must roll 1d20 on the
Master Table using the Rank Value of the character's Toughness. A result
of white immediately bounces the character back to the starting sector
where the character is dazed and must spend 1 d6 turns recovering
(taking no actions during that time). Any other result immediately
bounces the character back to the starting sector where the character is
dazed for one turn.

Wall Crawling
-------------

The character can move normally, either by using a specialized device or
innate means, across surfaces from which most people would fall (walls
and ceilings, for example). A Gamemaster should inflict a RS penalty
when attempting to move across a slippery surface.

Weapon
------

The character owns a unique weapon of the player's choice which deals
damage equal to its Rank Value.

Melee Weapon: The character makes melee attacks with the weapon using
the weapon's Rank Value or the character's combat attribute +1 RS,
whichever is greater. Ranged Weapon: The character uses the weapon's
Rank Value or the character's Reflexes +1 RS, whichever is greater, when
attacking. Incorporated Power: At the player's discretion one of the
character's other powers may be incorporated into the weapon increasing
the Rank Value of the incorporated power by +1 RS but losing the use of
the incorporated power if the weapon is lost or stolen.

Universe Rank Values
--------------------

In addition to character attributes, skills, and powers, Rank Values are
used to describe facets of the universe the characters interact with.

Sectors and Movement
--------------------

The standard unit of measuring distance in PHASE FOUR is known as a
sector. A sector is approximately how far an average human could run in
a turn, approximately 10 feet. The number of sectors a character may run
in a turn is determined by the Rank Value of Reflexes. This is a
baseline for all characters. Other Powers will grant other modes of
movement.

MOVEMENT

| Value | Sectors/Turns |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | 1             |
| 10    | 1d6           |
| 30    | 2d6           |
| 50    | 3d6           |
| 100   | 4d6           |

Common Substances
-----------------

Sometimes the strength of an object will come into play. In such
instances, use the Rank Value of the material according to the "Material
Toughness" table.

MATERIAL TOUGHNESS

| Value | Substance  |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | Paper      |
| 10    | Brick      |

Adjudication
------------

The Master Table is the key to any and all actions characters perform.
When a character attempts an action that will have an impact on the
storyline (i.e. leap from rooftop to rooftop or notice an enemy hiding
in a dark alley) the gamemaster does two things: 1 . Decides which
attribute or power applies to the action. For example, Strength for
jumping or Insight for noticing or Superspeed for running up a wall. 2.
Decides the difficulty of the action based on the "Action Difficulty"
table. Color White Green Yellow Red Difficulty Easy Average Difficult
Ridiculous The player then rolls 1d20 based on the appropriate Attribute
or Power and compares the color result to the color needed for success;
if the result equals the color or a greater color the character's action
succeeded. If the action fails, it is up to the gamemaster to determine
exactly what happens to the character as a result. Varying
Circumstances: In addition to setting the basic requirements for
success, the gamemaster can also use bonuses and penalties to reflect
favorable or unfavorable conditions; a -2 RS to jump between the top of
train cars, for example, or a +5 RS to sneak past a sleeping guard.

Combat
------

Combat in PHASE FOUR takes place in turns, each of which covers an
abstract amount of time equal to the action depicted in a single comic
book panel. A character can perform any action that would fit into a
standard panel including attack, dodge, or move. You may only attack
once in a turn (the exception is the Fast Attack power which grants
characters the ability to make multiple attacks in one turn). It is
possible to move and attack in the same turn but you suffer a -1 RS
penalty to your attack for every sector you move into unless you perform
a rush (see Rushing Attack). You may also move and dodge in the same
turn but you suffer a -1 RS penalty to your dodge for every sector you
move into.

During a turn the action takes place as follows: 1 . The Gamemaster
secretly determines the actions of Gamemaster Characters. 2. The players
each state their actions for the turn. 3. One player and the Gamemaster
each roll 1d20 to determine Initiative for their side; highest roll
wins. 4. The side that won Initiative acts. 5. The side that lost
Initiative now acts. 6. Repeat until the combat is over.

Damage
------

Characters start the game with a number of Health points equal to the
total of their first four attributes (Combat, Strength, Toughness,
Reflexes). Characters lose these points as they suffer damage throughout
the course of an adventure and may die if reduced to 0 Health points.
Characters recover all Health between adventures.

Altering the Dice
-----------------

After a roll is made, a character may spend 25 points from Energy Pool
to shift the result of a single roll one color left or right (from white
to green, green to yellow, yellow to red, or vice- versa) on the Master
Table. The roll altered can be the character's roll or someone else's
(ally or enemy). Points may be spent to further shift the color. Each
additional shift costs another 25 points. Multiple characters may spend
Energy to affect the same die roll.

Attack Types
------------

Attacks are broadly categorized into four types: Bashing, Slashing,
Ranged and Rushing. Depending on the type of attack, special effects may
come into play: Knock Out, Knock Back, Grievous Wound, and Nailed.
Special effects are all considered a Hit, and do damage even if their
specific effect is resisted by the defender.

Bashing Attack
--------------

Attacks with fists, feet, blunt weapons or dense objects are considered
a Bashing Attack. Roll 1d20 on the Master Table using the attacker's
Combat Rank Value and compare the result to the Bashing table.

Slashing Attack
---------------

Attacks with knives, swords, or other sharp objects are considered a
Slashing Attack. Roll 1d20 on the Master Table using the attacker's
Combat Rank Value and compare the result to the Slashing table.

Ranged Attack
-------------

Attacks with firearms, bows, thrown objects, and most attacks involving
distance are considered a Ranged Attack. Roll 1d20 on the Master Table
using the attacker's Reflexes Rank Value and compare the result to the
Ranged table.

Rushing Attack
--------------

To rush an opponent, a character must meet the following conditions; The
opponent can not be in the same sector as the attacker, and the attacker
must be able to reach the opponent in one turn. Roll 1d20 on the Master
Table using the attacker's Toughness Rank Value, gaining +1 RS, and
compare the result to the Rushing table.

Grievous Wound
--------------

The opponent is dealt a life threatening wound. Their Health drops to 0
and their Toughness Rank Value drops by -1 RS on the Master Table after
each turn, until it reaches a Rank Value 0, at which point death occurs.
If, however, they receive aid before reaching 0 Health, they can be
stabilized and remain unconscious until receiving advanced medical aid,
supernatural healing, or 1 d6 days of recovery time.

Knock Back
----------

The opponent is dealt a blow that may knock them off their feet. If the
attacker's Strength Rank Value is greater than the defender's Strength
Rank Value, then the defender must roll 1d20 on the Master Table using
the Rank Value of the defender's Toughness attribute. A result of white
indicates the defender is knocked down and into an adjacent sector of
the attacker's choice. A result of green results in the defender being
knocked down in the current sector. On a result of Yellow or higher, the
defender deflects the knock back attempt.

Knock Out
---------

The opponent is dealt a blow that may knock them unconscious. If the
attacker's Strength Rank Value is greater than the defender's Toughness
Rank Value, then the defender must roll 1d20 on the Master Table using
the Rank Value of the defender's Toughness attribute. A result of white
indicates the defender is knocked unconscious for 1 d6 turns. On a green
result or higher, the defender shakes off the knock out attempt.

Nailed
------

This is a called ranged attack on a specific target. It is used for
feats of marksmanship such as severing a rope with an arrow or shooting
a gun out of someone's hand; it deals damage to the target like a normal
hit The attacker must state the intention to try for this result before
rolling the attack. If a Nail is not declared before the dice are rolled
this result is treated as a Hit. The Gamemaster has the final say on the
effect of a successful Nail attack result.
